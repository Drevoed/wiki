# Authentication

To authenticate with the API, you must first acquire a bot token or user token:

- **Bot:** create one from user settings in the client
- **User:** copy one from client or [authenticate manually](/developers/api/reference.html#tag/session/post/auth/session/login) through API

Then you may provide these through either:

| Type |      Header       |
| :--: | :---------------: |
| Bot  |   `X-Bot-Token`   |
| User | `X-Session-Token` |

When dealing with an authenticated route.
